## History ##

In 1970 a company called bell lab created a common software for all computer and named it as "unix" . Initially, Unix was only found in large organizations like government, university, or larger financial corporations because it was expensive at that time for common people. Then in 1983, Richard Stallman developed GNU project with the goal to make it freely available Unix like operating system and to be used by everyone. But this project failed to gain popularity . Then 1991 a student name Linus Torvolds created a software to interact with system and name it as kernel. Later on Richard stallman and Linus Torvolds came together and created the first Linux based operating system known as GNU Linux.
